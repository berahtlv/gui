Practicing Kivy framework with the goal of network simulator like UI.

If you want to try it [install Kivy as described ](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html#)  (the one with SDL2) or if problems arise another options are 'kivy-team/kivy-daily' or  'github' repositories.

Code optimization advices are welcomed.
